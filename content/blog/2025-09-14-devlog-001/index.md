# Devlog #001: Starting the Journey

Welcome to our first development log! We're excited to share our progress with you.

## What We've Been Working On

This week has been all about laying the foundation for our new project:

### Game Design
- Finalized core gameplay mechanics
- Created initial character designs
- Drafted level progression system

### Technical Progress
- Set up development environment
- Implemented basic movement system
- Created initial UI mockups

## Challenges

We encountered some interesting challenges:
- **Performance**: Initial frame rate was lower than expected
- **Asset Pipeline**: Had to redesign our asset import workflow

## Solutions

We solved these issues by:
1. Profiling and optimizing the render loop
2. Implementing a new asset management system

## Next Steps

Looking ahead to next week:
- [ ] Polish character animations
- [ ] Implement sound system
- [ ] Begin level design

## Screenshots

Stay tuned for the next devlog!
